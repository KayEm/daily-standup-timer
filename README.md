#Introduction 
Simple daily standup timer to help team members in the standup meeting to stay focused and keep the meeting time-boxed to max. 15 minutes.

Each team member starts the timer, has 1 minute to answer the questions and finishes by stopping the timer.
- What did you do yesterday?
- What will you do today?
- Are there any impediments in your way?

If the countdown from 1 minute reaches 0, a stopwatch will start to count the overtime.
