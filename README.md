#Introduction 
Simple daily standup timer to keep the standup meeting timeboxed to 15 minutes.

Every participant at the standup meeting has up to 1 minute. The timer is started by touching the screen or clicking with the mouse.
The countdown goes from 1 minute to 0 and the participant can stop the countdown when he/she is done.
If the countdown is not stopped by the time the 1 minute is over, a stopwatch will start counting the overtime.
